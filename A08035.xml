            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN September laſt by Gods aſſiſtance, I fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed as I was able, a Booke <hi>Of the aſcention of the minde vnto God by the ſtepps of his Creatures.</hi> For hauing abandoned all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cares, I made choiſe to ſpend that Month by Licence of his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> in diuine contemplation.
<pb facs="tcp:16228:5"/>And albeit I writt it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for my priuate vſe: yet through the perſwaſions and aduiſe of friends; I haue publiſhed it, and made it appeare vnder the protection of your name. For no ſort of men may take more profitt thereby (if it ſhall profit any) then thoſe which are moſt occupied in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique affaires, eſpecially Prelats of the Church: Among whom you are not inferior vnto any; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Cardinal, an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, and Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine of the holy <hi>Roman

            <p>But perhappes not God, but creatures produced thy body, that as thy ſoule muſt acknowledge God, ſo thy body muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thy parents for au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: It is not ſo; For although God vſe the means of parents to begette the fleſh, as inferiour workemen in the buylding of a houſe; yet is he the cheife buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Author,</hi> and true fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both of the ſoule and

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16228:19"/>an end of the baſeneſſe of this matter: for that duſt or ſlime proceeded not from an other matter, but from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: In the beginning God created heauen and earth; and ſurely not of another heauen and earth, but of Nothing: ſo that whether we conſider the ſoule or body, it is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to <hi>Nothing</hi> from whence this proud creature Man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.

<note place="margin">Pſal. 33</note> 
               <hi>My ſoule ſhall be praiſed in our Lord.</hi> For I aske, when a man doth ſome excellent worke, of what matter doth he make it? by what vertue, and by whoſe direction and help doth he it? ſurely of a matter which God not man created, and by that vertue which God gaue vnto him, &amp; not he to himſelfe: by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16228:21"/>Gods direction and help alſo he doth it, without which he could doe no good. <hi>For God doth many good things in Man without Man; but Man doth no good which God doth not cauſe Man to doe,</hi> as it is ſaid in the ſecond <hi>Arauſican</hi> Councell c. 20. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth vouchſafe to vſe the miniſtery of man in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, the which he could doe without him, that Man may thereby acknowledge himſelfe, more indebted vnto God, and not be proude of himſelfe, but glory in our Lord.

            <p>It followeth now that we conſider the forme which is the third cauſe.
<note place="margin">Cap 4.</note> And truly by how much the matter whereof man is made is more baſe; by ſo much the forme giuen to man, is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.

            <p>Lift vp thy minde my ſoule to thy example, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that the cheife commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Image, is to be like thereunto.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16228:23"/>the image it ſhall be beautie. And if the example alſo be beautifull; the image ſhall be moſt pretious, if it imitate (as neere as may be) the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof: the image like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if it had vnderſtanding, would deſire nothing more, then continually to beholde the example, to faſhion and frame it ſelfe to become moſt like thereunto.</p>
            <p>Thy example O my ſoule is God an infinite beautie;
<note place="margin">1 Ioh. c. 1</note>

            </p>
            <p>But God thy example (O my ſoule) is <hi>Wiſdome</hi> and <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> and therefore <hi>Beautie it ſelfe.</hi> And becauſe both this goodneſſe is ſignified by the name of <hi>Holineſſe</hi> in the Scriptures,
<note place="margin">Iſay 6.</note> therefore in <hi>Iſay</hi> the Angels crye vnto God: <hi>Holy, holy, holy,

               <hi>Be you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as your heauenly Father is perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore thou deſire (O my ſoule) as the true image of God to be like thy example; thou muſt loue <hi>Wiſdome</hi> and <hi>Iuſtice</hi> before all

<note place="margin">Pſal. 48</note> 
               <hi>Now to be compared to beaſtes without vnderſtanding, and to become
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16228:27"/>like vnto them,</hi> ſurely thou couldeſt not but quake, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and be vnquiet, vntil thou hadſt waſhed away all thy ſpottes with floudes of teares flowing from deepe contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſpedily returne to the likenes of thy moſt beautifull example.

            <p>There remaineth then the laſt cauſe, which is the end.
<note place="margin">Cap. 5</note> The end wherefore man was created, is no other but God himſelfe. But becauſe the end is twofold, the one intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, the other externall, let vs briefly conſider each of them apart. The intrinſecal end of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing is the perfect eſtate to which it can come. As the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16228:28"/>intrinſe call end of a pallace is the perfect ſiniſhing thereof: for then it is ſaid to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, when as nothing belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the building is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: The intrinſecall end of a tree is the moſt perfect eſtate which the nature therof doth require: For then a tree may be ſaid to haue attained its end, when it ſpreadeth the boughes, bringeth forth leaues, is beautified with bloſſomes, and ſoone after loaded with ripe fruite. Man therefore who is created to a moſt high end, may then alſo be ſaid to haue attained his end, when as his minde ſhall ſee God as he is, and in him knowne all things; his will ſhall enioy the chiefe happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16228:28"/>moſt ardently loued; and his body being qualified with the glorious guiftes of immortalitie, impaſſibilitie, and the like; ſhall obtaine perpetuall reſt and ioy. And becauſe the ſight of God is the eſſence of this finall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, by which we which are the images of God muſt obtaine a moſt perfect eſtate by the reſemblance of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine example; therefore St. <hi>Iohn</hi> writeth:
<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3</note> 
               <hi>Now we are the ſonnes of God: and it hath not yet appeared, what we ſhall bee. We knowe that when he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, we ſhall be like to him: becauſe wee ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O my ſoule, if thou couldeſt conceaue what this meaneth:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16228:29"/>
               <hi>We ſhall be like to him, becauſe we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> how ſoone would all the cloudes of earthly thoughtes be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed? God is moſt happy, and therefore moſt happy, becauſe he doth alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold himſelfe as he is, and doth enioy himſelfe moſt cleerely ſeene, and moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently loued from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Of this ineſtimable good, he would haue thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo partaker with the Angels. To this moſt high and happy end he created thee, which is ſignified by that ſaying: <hi>Enter into the ioy of thy Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math 25</note> That is, Be partaker of the ioy which God himſelfe doth enioy. And againe,
<note place="margin">Luc. 22</note> 
               <hi>I diſpoſe to you, as my father diſpoſed to me a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16228:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>kingdome: that you may eate and drinke vpon my table in my kingdome,</hi> That is, I make you partakers of my kingdome, and kingly table, that you may enioy that honour, powre, and pleaſure, which I and God my Father enioy. And who is able to conceaue what is the honour, powre, pleaſure and happineſſe of God? truely if any would but in thought and hope aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend vnto the Highnes of our end; he would be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to contend for the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of this earth, to grieue for any temporall loſſe, or to ioy for any temporall gaine. He would I ſay be aſhamed to be a fellow in the pleaſures of beaſtes, who is made a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16228:30"/>companion of Angels, and a partaker of Gods friendſhip and of his ineſtimable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, <hi>For all thinges among friends are common.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now the externall end of euery thing, is that for which it is made. The end of a pallace is the dweller there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: the end of a tree is the poſſeſſor thereof: the end of man is onely his Lord God. For of his owne, and for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe he made Man, and he keepeth, feedeth, and payeth him his wages. Therefore iuſtly doth he command and ſay:
<note place="margin">Deut. 6</note> 
               <hi>The Lord thy God ſhalt thou adore, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerue.</hi> But mark diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly O my ſoule; The things which are made for man, are

<note place="margin">1.

Neither is that firſt &amp; greateſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable onely to man obeying, &amp; not to God commanding: but alſo the reſt of Gods commandements do perfect, beautifie, inſtruct and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the obedient, and finally make them good and happy. Therefore my ſoule if thou be wiſe vnderſtand that thou art created to Gods glorie, and thy eternall happineſſe; that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16228:32"/>is thy end, that is thy treaſure and center; if thou come to that end, thou ſhalt be happy, if thou declyne from it, thou art vnhappy. Therefore think that aſſuredly good for thee, which directeth thee to that end: and that aſſuredly euill which cauſeth thee to decline from it. Proſperitie and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie, wealth and pouertie, health and ſickneſſe, honour and ignominy, life and death, of a wiſe man are neither to be deſired nor auoyded; but if they make to Gods glorie, and thy eternall welfare, they are good, and to be deſired: if they hinder it, they are euill and to be auoyded.</p>

And what I pray you is the greatneſſe of the earth compared to the

Goe too now my ſoule, I aske thee, if the world be ſo great, how great is he that made the world? Great is our Lord, and there is no end of his greatneſſe. Heare <hi>Iſay:
<note place="margin">Iſay 40</note> Who hath meaſured the waters with his fiſt and ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the heauens with a ſpanne?

               <note place="margin">Gen. 15 Gen. 22</note> And in another place they are compared to the ſandes of the Sea, which are innumerable. Of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels <hi>Daniel</hi> writeth:

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16228:37"/>That the multitude of Angels, exceedeth in number all materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things.</hi> Therefore this almoſt infinite multitude of things made by one God, doth demonſtrate that in the diuine eſſence there are infinite perfections. For God would be knowne to man in ſome ſort by his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and becauſe no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can truely repreſent the infinite perfection of the Creator; he hath multiplied the Creatures, and hath giuen to euery one ſome goodnes &amp; perfection, that therby may be gathered the goodnes and perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Creator, who in one moſt ſimple offence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth infinite perfections; euen after a ſort as one peece
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16228:38"/>of gold conteyneth the value of many peeces of braſſe. Therefore my ſoule, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thou doſt ſee or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, which ſeemeth to thee admirable; let it be a <hi>Ladder</hi> to aſcend to the knowledge of thy Creator, who without doubt is much more admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

<note place="margin">Wiſd. 14</note> ſhall inſtruct, not deceaue, and direct not miſguide thee from the way of vertue. And if thou poſſeſſe gold, ſiluer and precious ſtones; ſay in thy hart, my God is more pretious, who hath promiſed me himſelfe, if I contemne theſe things. If thou admire
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:16228:38"/>earthly Empires and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: ſay in thy hart; more excellent is the kingdome of heauen which remaineth for euer, which God (who lyeth not) hath promiſed to thoſe that loue him. If pleaſures and delights begin to tickle thy carnall ſenſes: ſay in thy hart; the pleaſure of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is more delightfull, then of the fleſh, and the delights of the minde, ſurpaſſe thoſe of the belly, for the mortal crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture offordeth them, and the immortall Creator the other; which whoſoeuer taſteth, may ſay with the Apoſtle: <hi>I am repleniſhed with conſolation:

            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, if any beautifull,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:16228:39"/>great or wonderfull thing be offered thee beſide thy Lord God: anſwere aſſuredly, what goodneſſe ſoeuer is therein; the ſame without doubt is much more and better in thy Lord: and therefore it is not profitable for thee to change gold for braſſe, pretious ſtones for glaſſe, great things for ſmall, certaine for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, &amp; temporall for eternall.</p>
            <p>But although the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Creatures is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, and declareth the manifold perfections of <hi>one God:</hi> yet more admirable is the varietie of things which is ſeen in that multiplication. For it is not hard, with one Seale to expreſſe many figures alike, or with the ſame mould
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:16228:39"/>to print innumerable letters: but to diſtinguiſh the formes almoſt infinite waies, as God did in the creation, is plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adiuine worke moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of admiration.

And is not the like alſo in liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that haue ſence? but what ſhall I ſay of men, ſince in a great Armie, there can hardly be found two men alike? which alſo is verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſtarres and Angels:

            </p>
            <p>Lift vp then my ſoule thine eyes to God, in whom are the cauſes of all things; and from whom as from a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>of infinite plentie,</hi> this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt infinite <hi>Varietie did flowe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For God could not haue imprinted thoſe innumerable formes in creatures, without comprehending the cauſes of them in the boſome of his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence after a moſt high and

But (omitting the reſt) let vs ſpeake of thoſe things which in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and opinion of all men are beautifull. Great ſurely is the beauty of a greene Meadow, of a well kept Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, of a pleaſant Wood, of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:16228:47"/>a calme Sea, of a cleere ayre, of Fountaines, Riuers, Citties, and of the bright skye garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with innumerable ſtars, like Iemmes.

The ſhapes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of diuers kinds of foure-footed beaſtes, the flight of birdes, and the ſporting of fiſhes? What ſhall I ſay of the beauty of the Moone and ſtarres, but eſpecially of that great and bright Planet the Sunne which comforteth all the world at his ryſing?

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16228:48"/>notwithſtanding, many ſaints haue bin ſo inflamed with the loue thereof, that ſome of them haue hid themſelues in Deſertes, and attended onely to the contemplation therof, as St. <hi>Mary Magdalen, Paul</hi> the firſt Heremite, the great <hi>Anthony</hi> and others of whom you may reade in the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hiſtory of <hi>Theodoret.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, (forſaking their wiues and Children, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer els they poſſeſſed on earth) liued in Monaſteries vnder the obedience of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that they might enioy the friendſhip of God.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16228:49"/>Heare one of them, to wit, St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> the Martyre in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans: Let fire, gallowes, beaſtes, breaking of my bones, quartering of my members, bruſing of my body, and all the torments of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill come vpon me, ſo that I may enioy Chriſt.</hi> If then this diuine beauty not yet ſeene but onely beleeued and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, could kindle ſuch a feruent deſire, what will it doe when as the vaile being remooued, it ſhall be ſeene as it is in it ſelfe?

               <hi>That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drunke with the torrent of that pleaſure,</hi> we neither will nor can one moment turne our eyes from it. And what wonder is it, although the

            <p>Seeke that beauty O my ſoule, ſigh after it day and night: ſay with the Prophet, <hi>My ſoule hath thirſted after thee the ſtrong liuing,

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16228:50"/>rather from the body, and to be preſent with our Lord.</hi> Neither doe thou feare to be defiled with the loue of that beauty; For the loue thereof doth comfort not corrupt, doth purifie and not polute the hart. The holy virgin and martyre St. <hi>Agnes</hi> ſayd truely, I loue Chriſt whoſe mother is a virgin, whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knoweth no woman; whom when I loue I am chaſte, when I touch I am cleane, when I take I remaine a virgin.

            <p>WE haue conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Corporall world in generall:
<note place="margin">Cap. 1</note> Let vs now conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the principall parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that from them we may erect a <hi>Ladder</hi> to contemplate their maker.</p>
            <p>Firſt there is the <hi>Earth,</hi> the which although it occupie the loweſt place among the elements, and ſeemeth to be leſſe then the reſt: yet it is not leſſe then the water; and in dignitie and worth it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth the other elements.</p>
            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:16228:52"/>
            <p> Whereupon we often read in holy Scripture: That God made heauen and earth as the principall parts of the world;
<note place="margin">Gen. 1</note> For he made heauen as the Pallace of God and Angels: the earth, as the Pallace of men:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 113</note> 
               <hi>The heauen of heauen is to our Lord</hi> (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) <hi>but the earth he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the children of men.</hi> And that is the cauſe why the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is full of bright ſtarres, &amp; the earth aboundeth with mettalls, precious ſtones, hearbes, trees and beaſtes of diuers kindes, whereas the water is ſtored onely with fiſh, and the ayre and fire, are in a manner emptie and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked elements. But omitting this; The earth hath three

            <p>Firſt the earth is the moſt firme foundation of the whole world, without which we could neither walke, worke,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 92</note> reſt nor liue. <hi>He hath eſtabliſhed</hi> (ſaith <hi>Dauid) the round world which ſhall not be mooned,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the earth (like a good Nurſſe to men and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liuing creatures) doth daily bring forth herbs, fruits, graſſe &amp; innumerable things of like kinde. For ſo God ſpeaketh:

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly the earth bringeth forth ſtones &amp; wood to build houſes, and mettalls of braſſe and yron for diuers vſes, and gold and ſiluer wherof money is made, which is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby all thinges ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the life of man are eaſily procured.</p>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16228:54"/>
               <hi>Thou haſt made vs O Lord</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine) for thy ſelfe,

            <p>Let vs ſee now if all theſe things could content &amp; ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the deſires of his minde: <hi>When I had</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>turned my ſelfe to all the workes which my hands had don,

Salomon</hi> therefore found not contentment in all his riches, delights, wiſdome and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; neither could he, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had enioyed much more: For the ſoule of man is immortall, and theſe things are mortall, and cannot long remaine vnder the Sunne; neither can it be that a ſoule which is capable of infinite good, ſhould be ſatisfied with finite goods. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the body of man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſt in the ayre although it be moſt ſpatious, nor in the water although it be very deepe, becauſe the earth is the place thereof, and not the ayre or water: ſo the minde
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:16228:56"/>of man is neuer ſatisfied with ayrie dignities, nor watry wealth, to wit, with ſoft and deceauing pleaſures, nor with the falſe glory of humane knowledge, but with God onely, who is the center of ſoules, and their onely true reſting place.</p>
            <p>O how truely and wiſely did the father of <hi>Salomon</hi> ſay: <hi>What is to me in heauen,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 72</note> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thee what would I vpon earth? God of my hart, and God my portion for euer.</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaid: I finde nothing in heauen or earth, or in any creature therein, that can giue me true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; thou onely art the God of my hart, that is, thou onely art a firme rocke to my
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:16228:57"/>hart; for the word <hi>(God)</hi> in the Hebrew text ſignifieth a rocke in that place. Thou therefore art onely a moſt firme rocke to my hart, in thee onely will I reſt, thou onely art my portion, my inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and all my good; other things are nothing, nor of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny force to ſuffice me one day, but thou alone wilt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice me for euer.</p>
            <p>Doſt thou not knowe as yet my ſoule, that God onely is the rocke whereupon thou muſt reſt; and that in al things els is vanitie and affliction of ſpirit? For they are not, but appeare to be, they comfort not, but afflict, becauſe they are gotten with labour, kept with care &amp; loſt with ſorrow.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:16228:57"/>Deſpiſe therefore if thou be wiſe all tranſitory thinges, leaſt they carry thee away with them, and abide in that vnitie and bond of Charitie which continueth for euer.

            <p>But that ſoule is indeede miſerable, whoſe houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing built vpon the ſand, cannot continue long: And the fall therof will be great; becauſe it beleeueth lyes and truſteth to a ſtaffe of Reede: Whoſe God is the belly, or money, or the ſmoake of honour; all which things paſſe away and periſh very ſpeedily, &amp; drawe the ſoule which followeth them into eternal diſtruction.</p>

<note place="margin">Cap. 6</note> for from them alſo may the minde be eleuated to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his wonderfull workes. And not without cauſe is God called in holy ſcripture <hi>A Fountaine of life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 35 Eccle. 1</note> And, <hi>A Fountaine of liuing water.</hi> And that he is <hi>the Fountaine of Being;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hier. 2</note> We gather by theſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:16228:76"/>wordes of God to <hi>Moyſes: I am which am,
<note place="margin">Exod. 3</note> he which is hath ſent me to you.</hi> All which, the Apoſtle ſeemeth to haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded when he ſaith:
<note place="margin">Act. 17</note> 
               <hi>In him we liue, and moue, and be.</hi> For in him we are, as in a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of being; In him we liue, as in a Fountaine of life; And in him we mooue, as in a Fountaine of Wiſdome,
<note place="margin">Wiſd. 7</note> becauſe <hi>Wiſdome is more moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then all moueable things: &amp; reacheth euery where becauſe of her cleanneſſe</hi> as it is ſaid in the booke of Wiſdome.</p>
            <p>A fountaine of water with vs hath this propertie, that Riuers ſpring from it; and when they ceaſe to flowe from their fountaine, they are ſoone dried vp: but the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:16228:77"/>fountaine dependeth not of the riuers; for it receaueth not water from them but from it ſelfe, and giueth it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others. This is a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of the diuinitie; For God is the moſt true fountaine <hi>of Being:</hi> becauſe he receaued his <hi>Being</hi> from no other thing; but all thinges receiued their being from him. God receaued his <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> from no other thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his <hi>eſſence</hi> is to <hi>be,</hi> and his <hi>being</hi> is his <hi>exiſtence;</hi> ſo that, it cannot be conceaued or cauſed but that God hath beene alwayes, and alwayes ſhall be. Other thinges may be for a time, and for a time not be: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe exiſtence doth not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:16228:77"/>belong vnto their offence. For example: It belongeth to the eſſence of a man to be a reaſonable creature: and therefore he cannot be a man vnleſſe he be a reaſonable creature: and if exiſtence belonged al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the eſſence of a man, he ſhould then alwayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt: but becauſe it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to his eſſence; therefore hee may exiſt and not exiſt. God then is the <hi>Fountaine of Being</hi> becauſe his eſſence includeth actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all exiſtence for euer, as is ſignified by thoſe wordes <hi>I am: Which am.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 3</note> That is, I am eſſence it ſelfe, and receaue not my <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> from any other thing;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:16228:78"/>for to me onely <hi>my eſſence is my exiſtence.</hi> Therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie and immortalitie is proper vnto God onely as the apoſtle ſaith: <hi>To the king of the worldes immortall,
<note place="margin">1 Tim 1 1 Tim. 6</note> onely God,</hi> And, <hi>who onely hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie.</hi> For all other things receaue in ſuch ſort their eſſence from God; that vnleſſe they doe alwaies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend one him, and be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by him; they preſently ceaſe to be. Wherevpon the ſame Apoſtle ſaith:
<note place="margin">Heb. 1</note> 
               <hi>Who ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth all thinges by the word of his power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore O my foule ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and reuerence the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodneſſe of thy maker, who maintaineth and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all thinges ſo louingly,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16228:78"/>although he needeth not their ſeruice. Admire and Imitate alſo the patience of thy ſayd maker who is ſo mercifull vpon <hi>the vnkinde and the euill,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 6</note> that he feedeth and preſerueth thoſe which blaſpheme him, and deſerue to be brought to nothing. Let it not therefore ſeeme much vnto thee, to beare ſometimes with the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thy brethren, and (as thou art commanded) to doe good to thoſe that hate thee.</p>
            <p>But the being a Fountaine, doth not onely conſiſt in not receauing being from an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fountaine, and in giuing being vnto other things; For the water both of Fountaines and Riuers with vs is of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:16228:79"/>ſame kinde; and albeit that fountaines receaue not their water from other fountaines; yet they haue a cauſe of their being, to wit, vapours, which alſo haue other cauſes ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſinely, vntill we come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the firſt cauſe. But God thy maker (my ſoule) is not of the ſame kinde with creatures; but infinitely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth them in dignitie, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, and excellencie. He alſo is truely and properly the <hi>Fountaine of Being,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth not onely not receaue his <hi>being,</hi> from an other <hi>fountaine of being,</hi> but alſo, for that he hath no cauſe at all. A Fountaine of created water (as is ſaid) is not deriued from any other
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16228:79"/>water; but from an other cauſe: but the increated Fountaine of <hi>Being</hi> hath not my thing before himſelfe, dependeth not of any thing, wanteth not any thing, nor can he hurt by any thing; but all thinges depend of him,
<note place="margin">2 Mach. 8</note> and he can <hi>Deſtroy the whole world with a becke</hi> as ſaith the valiant <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Admire this eminencie (O my ſoule) this begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, without beginning, this Cauſe without Cauſe, this eſſence that is infinite, vnlimited, immenſe and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon wherof, all other things are but caſuall. And of this perhappes the <hi>Truth</hi> ſaid:
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:16228:80"/>
               <hi>But one thing is neceſſary.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 10</note> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here therefore to him onely, ſerue him onely, and delight in his loue onely. Deſpiſe all other thinges for his ſake; or els be not troubled with too much care about many thinges, (ſince one thing is neceſſarie which onely is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for thee and al others) but let thy care be neuer to fall from his grace, ſtudying alwaies and euery where how to pleaſe him.</p>
            <p>God alſo is moſt truely called a <hi>Fountaine of life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap 7</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath life in himſelfe, and is life eternall it ſelfe: <hi>He is the true God,
<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5</note> and life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Iohn;</hi> and all thinges that liue, receaue life from that fountaine, which
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:16228:80"/>when it ſhall ceaſe to giue them life, <hi>They ſhall fayle,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 103</note> and ſhall returne into their duſt</hi> as the holy Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith. It is proper vnto li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures to beget their like. God alſo begott a Sonne moſt like vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
<note place="margin">Ioh. 5</note> 
               <hi>For us the Father hath life in himſelfe: So he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Sonne alſo to haue life in himſelfe,</hi> as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in the Goſpell: But the Father hath life in himſelfe becauſe he is the fountaine of life: and the Sonne hath life in himſelfe, becauſe the Father hath giuen him the ſame life which he hath, wherby the Sonne alſo is the fountaine of life; yet the Fountaine of life of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:16228:81"/>
               <hi>Fountaine of life,</hi> as God <hi>of God,</hi> and light <hi>of light.</hi> Who can declare or conceaue what the life of God is, and what this <hi>Fountaine of life</hi> is from whence all thinges that liue in heauen or earth drawe drops of life? The life which we in this baniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t know, is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but <hi>The internall beginning of Motion.</hi> For thoſe things we ſay liue, which mooue themſelues after ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And therefore the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Riuers is commonly called running or liuing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe it ſeemeth to moue of it ſelfe; And the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Ponds ſtanding or dead water, For that it is not moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued but by the Windes, or ſome other externall force.</p>
            <pb n="137" facs="tcp:16228:81"/>
            <p> Thy God O my ſoule moſt truely liueth, and is the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Fountaine of life.</hi> For often doth he in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inculcate this ſaying:
<note place="margin">Num. 14</note> 
               <hi>Liue I ſaith our Lord,</hi> And the Prophets often repeate: <hi>The Lord liueth, the Lord liueth.</hi> And in <hi>Hieremie</hi> God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of the people ſaying:
<note place="margin">Hier. 2</note> 
               <hi>They haue forſaken me the Fountaine of liuing Water;</hi> and yet he is not moued either by himſelfe or by any other: <hi>I am God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and am not changed.</hi> And againe,
<note place="margin">Hier. 16 Malae. 3 Num. 23</note> 
               <hi>God is not as the ſonne of Man that he may be changed.</hi> We ſing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo very often in the <hi>eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call hymne: O God which doſt preſerue the ſtrength of things, &amp; (thy ſelfe being vnmoueable)
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:16228:82"/>doſt ſucceſſiuely diuide the day and night &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that if God beget a ſonne, he begetteth him without mutation: and if he ſee, heare, ſpeake, loue, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don or iudge; he doth all without mutation: And if he create and preſerue; or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and diſſipate, and againe renue and change; yet he worketh reſting, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth without being changed. How then doth he liue if he moue not? And how doth he not liue if he be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and author of life? This knot is eaſily vntyed. For to liue it is abſolutely enough, that the thing which liueth worke of it ſelfe, and be nor moued by an other. But life
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:16228:82"/>for the moſt part in Creatures is the Internall beginning of motion, becauſe Creatures are vnperfect, &amp; haue need of many things to performe the actions of life: But God is <hi>Infinite perfection,</hi> and hath neede of nothing without himſelfe, and therefore he worketh of himſelfe and is not moued by any other. Creatures neede mutation to ingender, and be ingendred, becauſe they ingender with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out themſelues, and the thing ingendred muſt be changed from <hi>a not being to a being:</hi> But God begot a ſonne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelfe. And within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe produceth the holy ghoſt; neither ought the Son or the holy Ghoſt to be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:16228:83"/>changed from <hi>a not being to a being,</hi> becauſe they receaue that <hi>being</hi> which was alwaies; and they receaue it not in time but from eternitie.</p>
            <p>Creatures need the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Augmentation,</hi> becauſe they are borne vnperfect: but God the Sonne is borne moſt perfect, and God the Holy ghoſt is breathed and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced moſt perfect. Creatures need the motion of alteration to attaine diuers qualities which they want: but God wanteth nothing, for his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is <hi>of infinite perfection.</hi> Creatures neede locall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe they are not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where: but God is wholy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where. Moreouer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures need many things to ſee,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:16228:83"/>heare, ſpeake and worke; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their life is poore and vnperfect: but God needeth nothing without himſelfe to ſee all, heare all, ſpeake to all, and to worke all; For he (as is ſaid) is life it ſelfe, and the <hi>Fountaine of life.</hi> And that we may put an example in ihe action of ſeeing. A man to ſee, needeth a ſeeing power, which is diſtinct from the ſoule which properly ſeeth; he needeth an obiect, that is a coloured body diſtant from him; he needeth the light of the Sunne, or of ſome other bright body; he needeth a <hi>Medium,</hi> that is a perſpicuous body; he needeth a <hi>ſenſible Species</hi> or forme to be caried from the obiect to the eye; he
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:16228:84"/>needeth a <hi>corporall orga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> to wit an eye furniſhed with humors &amp; fleſhy tunicles, he needeth ſenſitiue ſpirits, and opticke ſynowes by which thoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits muſt paſſe; he needeth a proportionable diſtance; And laſtly he needeth the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the ſeeing powre or facultie.</p>
            <p>Behold how many thinges men and other liuing Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures want, to performe one action of life: But God who truely hath all life in himſelfe, needeth nothing. His infinite eſſence doth include power, forme, obiect, light and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things. God of himſelfe, by himſelfe, and in himſelfe, ſeeth all thinges which are, haue bin, or ſhall be, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:16228:84"/>knoweth all thinges which may be. And before the world was made, God ſawe all things, ſo that by the creation of things there came nothing but was before knowne vnto him. What then ſhalt thou be my ſoule, when thou ſhalt partake of that life? Is it much that God commandeth thee, when he would haue thee ſpend this corporall, animall, poore and vnperfect life for himſelfe and thy brethren, to obtaine life eternall? And if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund not much when he commandeth this life to be contemned, how light and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ought it ſeeme to thee, when he commandeth thee to beſtowe thy dead riches v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:16228:85"/>the poore, to abſtayne from luſt, to renounce the Deuill and his pompes, and with true deuotion of hart to ſigh after that life which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is true life.</p>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16228:89"/>what we want, and is ready to giue vs abundantly, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it belong to our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſaluation: but he will giue it vs by meanes of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for that is more to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and our proffit, then if he ſhould giue vs all thinges when as we ſleepe and doe nothing.</p>
            <p>Therefore our moſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall Lord doth exhort and vrge vs to aske when he ſaith:
<note place="margin">Luk. 11</note> 
               <hi>Aske and it ſhall be giuen you: Seeke and you ſhall finde: knocke and it ſhall be opened to you. For euery one that asketh, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth; and he that ſeeketh findeth: and to him that knocketh, it ſhall be opened.</hi> And what is chiefely to be asked,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:16228:90"/>and what without doubt ſhall be granted, he declareth a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after ſaying: <hi>If you then being naught knowe how to giue good giftes to your children, how much more will your father from heauen giue the good ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to them that aske him?</hi> This good <hi>Spirit</hi> therefore is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be daily asked; which doubtleſſe will be giuen vs if it be well asked; whereby we may breath in God, and by breathing in him preſerue our ſpirituall life. So did holy <hi>Dauid</hi> who ſaid in the pſalme:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 118</note> I <hi>opened my mouth and drewe breath.</hi> That is, I opened my mouth crauing with vnexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable ſighes, And I <hi>drew</hi> the moſt ſweete breath of Gods ſpirit, which hath cooled the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16228:90"/>heate of my concupiſcence, and ſtrengthned me in euery good worke. which being ſo, who can ſay that they liue to God who in whole dayes, monthes, and yeares ſigh not after him, nor breath in him? Not to breath is an euident ſigne of death; therefore if to pray be to breath, it is an euident ſigne of death not to pray. The ſpirituall life wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are made the ſonnes of God, conſiſteth in charitie; <hi>See</hi> (ſaith St.
<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3</note> 
               <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>what manner of Charitie the Father hath giuen vs, that we ſhould be named and be the ſonnes of God.</hi> And who is there that loueth, but deſireth to ſee the thing he loueth? who deſireth any thing and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16228:91"/>asketh not, when he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that for asking it ſhall be giuen him? Therefore, who ſo doth not dayly pray to ſee the face of his God; deſireth not to ſee him: if he deſireth not to ſee him he loueth him not: if he loueth him not, he liueth not. What then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, but that we account them dead to God, although they liue to the world, which doe not giue themſelues to prayer. And yet ſuch are not ſaid to pray and thereby to breath and liue, which with their corporall voyce pray onely: For prayer is defined by the learned to be <hi>an eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the minde vnto God, and not of the voyce into the ayre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therfore my ſoule deceaue
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16228:91"/>not thy ſelfe, thinking thou doſt liue to God vnleſſe thou ſeeke God withall thy hart, and ſigh after him day and night. Say not that thou canſt not for other buſineſſe; giue thy ſelfe to prayer and ſpirituall exerciſes. For the holy Apoſtles were moſt bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, but indeed in the worke of God and ſaluation of ſoules, ſo that on of them ſayde:
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11</note> 
               <hi>Beſide thoſe thinges which are outwardly: my dayly inſtance, the carefulneſſe of all Churches. Who is weake and I am not weake? Who is ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and I am not burnt?</hi> And yet the ſame Apoſtle beſide the often commemoration of his prayers, writeth vnto the <hi>Philippians:
<note place="margin">Philip. 3</note> our conuerſation
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:16228:92"/>is in heauen.</hi> For in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of buſineſſe, in deſire he was in heauen, els would he not haue ſaid:

            </p>
            <p>It is an other property of the ayre to be the <hi>Medium</hi> or meanes whereby colours and ſoundes come to our eyes and eares,
<note place="margin">Cap. 2</note> without which we could not ſee, heare, or ſpeak. Wherefore we ought greatly to thanke God that it hath pleaſed him to beautifie our nature with ſo ſingular a benefit. We ought alſo to admire the wiſdome of our maker in a worke of ſo great ſubtilitie; For although the ayre be a true body, and ſo
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:16228:92"/>great that it filleth almoſt an infinite ſpace; yet it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeene nor felt, by reaſon of the vncredible raritie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The auncients did wonder at the ſmalneſſe of a lyne which <hi>Apelles</hi> had drawne with a pencill; but that line was ſeene and touched; and therfore not to be compared with the thinneſſe of the ayre, which couereth and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all, and yet is ſeene of none. And it is the more to be wondred, that the ayre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo thinne a body, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diuided, it cloſeth againe together, with meruaylous facilitie, and remaineth as if it had neuer bin diuided. True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is not poſſible for an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen ſo to amend a Spiders
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:16228:93"/>broken cob web, or the rent of a very thinne <hi>Veyle;</hi> but that the former renting will appeare. It is alſo moſt worthy of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and onely belongeth to the wiſdome of God, to cauſe innumerable kindes of colours to paſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without confuſion through the ſame part of the ayre. For he who ſhall ſtand in a high and open place in the euening when the moone ſhineth, and behold the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen full of ſtarres, and fieldes full of flowers, with hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, trees, beaſtes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges of like ſort; cannot denie but that the Species or formes of thoſe thinges are conteyned in
<pb facs="tcp:16228:93"/>the <hi>Ayer</hi> next vnto him alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without confuſion. But who can conceiue this? For how can it bee that ſo thinne a body ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine together ſuch variety of formes? And what if at the ſame time and place, Birdes ſing, Inſtruments of muſicke play, and Waters falling make a noiſe, are not thoſe ſoundes or <hi>Formes of Soundes</hi> receiued altogether, with ſo many colours or formes of colours in the ſame <hi>Ayer?</hi> Who doth theſe thinges O my Soule but thy Maker, <hi>Who onely</hi> doth great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders?</p>
            <p>And if his workes are ſo wonderfull how much more wonderfull is hee himſelfe?
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:16228:94"/>An other commoditie alſo the ayre affoordeth by reaſon of the exceeding raritie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; For it helpeth the motion of all thinges that re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

And if perhapps a way be to be made through hills and Mountaines al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though but ſhort; yet in how long time and with what la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is it performed? But in the ayre horſes runne, birdes flye, and arrowes and Dartes are ſhot with great

            </head>
            <p>THe Element of <hi>Fire</hi> is ſo pure and noble,
<note place="margin">Cap. 1</note> that God himſelfe would be called fire as <hi>Moſes</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> witnes ſaying: <hi>Our Lord is a conſuming Fire.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut, 4 Heb, 12</note> And when God firſt appeared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Moſes,</hi> hee appeared in a flame of Fire burning a buſh and not conſuming it:
<note place="margin">Exod 3</note> 
               <hi>Our Lord appeared</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>in aflame of Fire, out of the midſt of a buſh: And he ſaw that the buſh was on fire, and was not burnt.</hi> And when the ſame God came to giue the Law
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:16228:102"/>vnto the people, hee came in the forme of fire. For ſo ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <hi>Moſes:
<note place="margin">Exo. 19</note> All the Mount</hi> Sinai <hi>ſmoaked: For becauſe our Lord was deſcended vpon it in Fire.</hi> According to the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of which miſtery, when as the new Law was to bee promulged; the holy Ghoſt appeared vnto the Apoſtles in fiery tongues.
<note place="margin">Act. 2</note> Thoſe ſpirits alſo which are moſt neare to God in Heauen, are called <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphins,</hi> that is to ſay <hi>Fiery,</hi> becauſe they are more infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the <hi>Fire of Diuine Loue,</hi> then other Angells. Which being ſo, it is not a thing difficult for vs, from the element of Fire, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and properties thereof, to frame a <hi>ſtep</hi> by which through
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:16228:102"/>prayer and meditation wee may Aſcend vnto God. For ſurely it is more eaſie to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend with <hi>Elias</hi> in a Chariot of Fire; then of <hi>Earth, Water</hi> or <hi>Ayre</hi> to make a <hi>Ladder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs therefore conſider the properties of the <hi>Fire.</hi> The fire is of ſuch a nature, that in diuers thinges it worketh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a diuerſe, and often after a contrary manner. Wood, Hay, and ſtubble it burneth preſently: Gold, Siluer, and precious ſtones it maketh more pure and bright: Iron which of it owne nature is blacke, colde, hard and hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uy; the Fire ſo changeth into contrary quallities, that forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it becommeth white, hot, ſoft and light; yea to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:16228:103"/>ſhine like a ſtarre, to burne like fire, to melt like water, and to bee ſo light, that the Smith may eaſily mooue and remoue it as he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>All theſe thinges doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſeſtly agree vnto Almighty God. For Wood, Hay, and ſtubble according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſignifie <hi>Euill workes</hi> which cannot indure the fire of Gods <hi>Iudgement.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor, 3</note> And truly it is vncredible how greatly all ſinne diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God who is a <hi>Moſt pure Fire;</hi> and with what zeale he conſumeth and deſtroyeth it, if by repentance it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, that is, If the ſinner bee in ſtate to repent: But if hee be not capable of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:16228:103"/>(as the Deuils are not, nor men after this life) then is Gods wrath turned vpon him: For to <hi>God the impious and his impiety are odious alike</hi> ſaith the wiſe man.
<note place="margin">Wiſ, 14</note> And how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great this hatred is the Deuill can witnes, who ſinned once, and being a moſt noble Angell,

            <p>Moreouer the fire doth not onely make Iron that is black to become bright; but alſo that is colde to become hot, yea ſo fiery &amp; burning, that it ſeemeth to be fire it ſelf. Great is our Lord, and great is his power, which cauſeth a man that is cold by nature, and fearfull to ſpeake, or to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake any difficult thing: So ſoone as he is heate with the fire of Charitie,

            <p>But let vs ſpeake particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of this efficacie of the fire; And firſt let vs breifely treat of the efficacie of words and then of the efficacie of deedes. There are at this day many preachers of Gods word in the Church, and euer haue bin.

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:16228:115"/>the hartes of the hearers. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay I this, but that many Preachers haue lowdneſſe of voyce, and action of body: for Gunnes without either bullet or ſtone make a great noyſe when they are diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but to no purpoſe. That which is deſired, is, that they would ſhewe great zeale to God and the gaining of ſoules, not faynedly but truely, not ſtreyned but naturally flowing from the fountaine of the hart. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was ignorant of Rhetoricke; he onely was expert in guiding his Boate, and in caſting and amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Nettes: yet ſo ſoone as the holy Ghoſt deſcended vpon him in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:16228:115"/>fiery tongues, and repleniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with feruent Charity; he preſently began to ſpeake ſo powerfully, feruently, and effectuouſly in the middeſt of the Citty <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that with one Sermon hee conuerted many thouſands to beleeue and doe pennance.
<note place="margin">Act, 2</note> Yet wee reade not that in his Sermons he vſed much ſtraining of the voyce, or weariſome motion of the body.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Bonauenture</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that St. <hi>Francis</hi> was vnlearned, and that hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſtudied the Art of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricke; yet when hee Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to the people, hee was heard as an Angell from Heauen.

            <p>More ouer the efficacy of this Diuine fire is ſhewed as much in deedes, as in wordes: God determined by St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle to ſubdue <hi>Rome</hi> the chiefe Citty of the Empire and Lady of Nations vnto himſelfe.</p>
            <p>He determined alſo to ſend the reſt of the Apoſtles, ſome into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> ſome into <hi>India</hi> ſome into <hi>Scythia,</hi> ſome into the fartheſt part of <hi>Britany,</hi>

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:16228:130"/>alſo compareth it to a Giant, that by that reſemblance hee might in ſome ſort ſhew the moſt ſpeedy courſe thereof. But albeit he had not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to a Giant, but to the flight of Birdes and Arrowes, or to the Windes and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; yet ſhould it haue bin farre from the thing indeede. For if that be true which with our eyes we ſee, to witt that the Sunne in foure and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty houres, paſſeth about the whole compaſſe of his Orbe: And if the compaſſe of the Sunnes Orbe, exceedeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt without compariſon the compaſſe of the Earth: And if the Compaſſe of the Earth containeth about twenty thouſand miles: all which is

For whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall obſerue the riſing or ſetting of the Sunne, in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Horizon, as at Sea, or in a plaine field; ſhall perceiue the whole body of the Sunne to aſcend aboue the Horizon in leſſe ſpace then the eight part of an houre; And yet the Diameter of the Sunnes Body, is much greater then the Diameter of the Earth; which notwithſtanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thouſand myles.

It muſt needes be therefore, that the Sunne in that ſhort time in which the Pſalme <hi>Miſerere</hi> was twice read ouer, did runne much more then the ſpace of ſeauen thouſand myles.

            </p>
            <p>Laſtly (which is the chiefe) from the Sunne (the Father of corporall Light) all things proceed which growe on Earth: And <hi>thoſe thinges are

            <pb n="262" facs="tcp:16228:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> Heere then beginneth the excellencie of the ſoule, and her reſemblance with God. For God is <hi>a ſpirit</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>and they that adore him,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 4</note> muſt adore in ſpirit and veritie.</hi> But although <hi>God is a ſpirit,</hi> and the ſoule of man is alſo a ſpirit; yet God is a ſpirit vncreated, the ſoule a ſpirit created: whereupon it followeth that there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite difference between that ſpirit which is the ſoule, and that ſpirit which is God. As therefore the ſoule may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce for being a ſpirituall ſubſtance, excelling thereby the heauens and ſtarres in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of Nature; ſo ought ſhe alſo to be humbled vnto God her Maker, becauſe ſhe

            <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Cap. 2</note> the ſoule of Man is a ſimple ſpirit, and therefore immortall; for it hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within it ſelfe that can diſſolue it, or cauſe it to dye: but as it hath this priuiledge aboue the ſoules of brute beaſtes which dye with the bodie; ſo it ought likewiſe to admire and reuerence the excellencye of the Creator, who is not onely immortall, but alſo eternall.

               <hi>It was the true Light, which light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth euery man that commeth into the World.</hi>

            <p>This is a great dignity of the ſoule, whereby man is made like to God, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to Beaſtes.</p>

            <p> And from hence we may and ought to conſider the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite eminency</hi> and ſublimitie of God. For the ſoule is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the light of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; but God is <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Vnderſtanding.</hi> The ſoule diſcourſeth from the Cauſe to the effect, and from the Effect to the cauſe, and with great labour getteth knowledge: God ſeeth all things at once perfectly together. The ſoule vnderſtandeth thinges which are, and therefore her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge dependeth of thinges: God by his <hi>Vnderſtanding</hi> cauſeth thinges to be, and therefore their exiſtence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth of his knowledge. The ſoule in ſome ſort conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctureth of thinges to come:
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:16228:150"/>God ſeeth alwayes all thinges to come, as plainly as thinges paſt or preſent.</p>
            <p>The Soule wanteth many thinges to exerciſe the guift of vnderſtanding: As <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, Species, Phantaſie,</hi> and the like: God wanteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for his <hi>Eſſence</hi> is to him all thinges.</p>
            <p>Laſtly the Soule while it is in the body, cannot ſee God nor Angels, or it ſelfe, or any ſubſtance truely, though it be Corporall; many thinges alſo it knoweth not and is deceiued, coniecturing much by opinion, and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding little by demonſtration. But God knoweth all thinges without coniecture or error,
<note place="margin">Heb. 4</note> for <hi>All thinges are naked and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:16228:151"/>open to his eyes</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in his Epiſt.

But all theſethinges are nothing in compariſon of the <hi>Law eternall</hi> which liueth in the minde of God, from whence as from an euerſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fountaine, all Lawes and Ordinances haue ſprung. <hi>For there is one Law-maker and Iudge,</hi> God, ſaith St.

            <p>Fiftly the Soule of man hath a third kinde of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<note place="margin">Cap. 5</note> which conſiſteth in making thinges ingeniouſly. And truely Spiders know alſo how to make their cobwebs, Birdes their neſtes, Bees their hony, and Foxes their holes: But theſe Creatures by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of Nature,</hi> doe the ſame thinges after one and the ſame manner: But the ſoule of man by reaſon and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hath inuented innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Artes, by which it gouerneth, &amp; ruleth by force all other liuing Creatures.</p>
            <pb n="271" facs="tcp:16228:152"/>
            <p> Neither can Birdes eſcape by flight, Fiſhes by ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, Lyons and Beares by ſtrength, Horſes and Mules by fierceneſſe, nor Stagges and Goates by ſwiftneſſe.</p>
            <p>For euen Children take birdes, with ſnares and bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime; and Fiſhers with hookes and nettes, catch fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes. And Men by witt and art, include and carry Lyons and Beares, into Iron cages: take wilde Boares and Staggs in Toyles, or kill them with Iauelyns, and tame Horſes, and Mules, with the bridle, and make them fitt to be rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den on.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I ſay of the Art of <hi>Nauigation?</hi> How great light of Witt ſhined in the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:16228:153"/>ſoule of Man, when it taught great Shipps being heauily loaden, not onely to runne through the Maine with oares like feete, but alſo to flye with Sayles like winges?

What of <hi>Architecture?</hi> Who will not admire the Pallaces, Temples, Cittyes, Arches, Towers, Amphitheaters, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramides, and Pillars of ſtone? I omit the Artes of Painting and Engrauing, by which the Countenances of men, and other thinges, are ſo liuely

            <p>Giue thankes therefore O my ſoule to God, that it hath pleaſed him to make thy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo farre different from the nature of other liuing Creatures: And lift vp the eyes of thy minde vnto thy ſaid Maker, in whom is the true fountaine of that Witt and Wiſdome, which created all thinges.

            <p>Sixtly Mans ſoule hath Free-will,
<note place="margin">Cap. 6</note> in which it is like to God and Angels, and chiefly differeth from other Creatures. This is a great and admirable excellency.

            <p>Seauenthly,
<note place="margin">Cap. 7</note> Mans ſoule hath a reaſonable will, which not onely hath power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire good thinges preſent, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and corporal, as beaſts doe: but alſo good thinges abſent, vniuerſall, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, which are knowne by the light of faith or reaſon, vntill it come to the <hi>Higheſt Happineſſe</hi> which is God. This maketh the ſoule capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of vertues, and eſpecially of Charitie the Queene of vertues. Brute beaſtes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede haue the loue of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence; but the loue of friendſhip they knowe not.</p>
            <p>But thou my ſoule art by God made capable <hi>of Charitie
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:16228:157"/>(the Chiefe</hi> of all Guiftes) whereby God remaineth in thee and thou in him. <hi>For God is Charitie,
<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 4</note> and he that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in Charitie, abideth in God, and God in him.</hi> And if the Happineſſe of a created will be ſo great, what may we think of the Happineſſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the increated will is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? Onely the will of God is capable of infinite loue, wherewith the infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God is worthy to be loued. Neither doth his will want vertues, or needeth to be directed by his vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; for they are all one, as Wiſdome and Charitie in God is the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>Eightly,
<note place="margin">Cap. 8.</note> the ſoule of Man is in the body; but farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:16228:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>then the ſoules of brute beaſtes in their bodies. The ſoules of brute beaſtes are materiall, and extended ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their bodies: ſo that a part of it, is in a part of their body, and the whole, in their whole body. But the ſoule of Man (becauſe it is an indiuiſible ſpirit) is after an admirable manner <hi>Whole in all, and whole in euery part:</hi> ſo that, albeit it fill all the body, yet it occupieth no place in the body: And when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy groweth, the ſoule grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not; but beginneth to be where before it was not. And if a member be cut away, or withered; the ſoule is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, nor withered, but ceaſeth to be in that member
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:16228:158"/>where before it was, without hurt or mutilation. This is a true reſemblance of Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence in Creatures. For God is an indiuiſible ſpirit: and yet he filleth all the world and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery part thereof. Neither doth he occupie any place: But is <hi>Whole in all, and whole in euery part of the world:</hi> And when any creature is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, God beginneth to be in it, and yet he is not mooued: And when any creature is by chance deſtroyed, or dyeth: God is not deſtroyed or dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: but ceaſeth to be in it, without locall mutation.</p>
            <p>Thus farre then, God and the ſoule agree: but in many thinges, God (as it is meete) doth farre excell. For the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:16228:159"/>ſoule (before it can moue and gouerne the body) muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the forme of the body, and be ſo vnited vnto it; that of the ſoule and body is made one Man. But God, needeth not become the <hi>forme or ſoule of the world:</hi> Neither of him and the world, is one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded ſubſtance made: For his immencitie is ſuch, that he is euery where: his indiuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnitie ſuch, that he is who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euery where: And his omnipotencie ſuch that he worketh euery where.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, although the ſoule be ſaid to be in all the body: yet it is not properly but in the partes which haue life; and therefore it is not in the humors, in the hayre, in
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:16228:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>the nayles, or in dryed and dead members: But God is in all thinges both corporall and ſpirituall without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; neither can it be that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing exiſt wherin God is not. The ſoule alſo is but in her owne body which is narrow and ſtraight, &amp; where all the partes are continued together: But God is in this vniuerſalitie of thinges, although it be very great, and the partes thereof not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued together, but contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and adioyning. And if more worldes were made, God ſhould be in them all: for of him it is written:
<note place="margin">1 Par. 6</note> 
               <hi>The heauen and heauens of heauens doe not containe thee.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit new heauens and earthes
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:16228:160"/>were multiplied without end God ſhould fill them all, for no place can be where he ſhould not be.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, the ſoule of Man (beſide thoſe thinges which are ſaid) hath alſo in it an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure image of the <hi>Bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie;</hi> becauſe it hath a power to remember, to vnderſtand, and to loue: and alſo for that the minde doth by the vnderſtanding <hi>Forme a word:</hi> and from the minde and the word proceedeth loue: For that which is knowne by the minde and repreſented by the Word as Good, is forthwith by the <hi>Will</hi> loued and deſired. But God the Father did after a more high and diuine man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>begett God the Word,</hi> and

For the ſoule of Man produceth a <hi>Word,</hi> and a loue which are not ſubſtances, but accidents; and therefore no perſons: <hi>But God the Father</hi> did beget the <hi>word</hi> conſubſtantiall to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: And the Father and the word, <hi>breathed out the holy Ghoſt</hi> conſubſtantiall likewiſe to them both. Therefore the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt are truely three
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:16228:161"/>perſons. The ſoule of Man alſo, produceth a Word which continueth not long: and the Will produceth a loue which laſteth not long: but God the Father did beget <hi>The Wordeternall,</hi> and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Word did breath out the holy Ghoſt <hi>eternall,</hi> For God cannot be without his Word and Spirit. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore the ſoule of Man, by one Word repreſenteth but one thing: and therefore it multiplyeth the wordes not onely of the Minde, but alſo of the mouth. The will of Man likewiſe muſt produce many actes of Loue, if it will loue many thinges: but God with one Word ſpeaketh all truth, and with one Acte of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:16228:161"/>loue, loueth all good thinges.</p>
            <p>Tenthly and laſtly,
<note place="margin">Cap. 10</note> the ſoule of man whiles it is in the body; is not ſeene, heard, mooued, nor ſcarce concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be there: and yet from it all good thinges are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to the body: as ſenſe, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſpeech, ſubſiſtence, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſtrength and the like; For how could a man ſee, heare, ſpeake, walke, ſubſiſt, and be ſtrong, faire, and amiable, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe his ſoule were in him?

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:16228:175"/>deſire to pleaſe God; that while they ſing his prayſes, they loue him with reuerence and reuerence him with loue. This the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth ſaying:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 2</note> 
               <hi>Serue our Lord in feare: and reioyce to him with trembling.</hi> From hence thou mayſt learne my ſoule with what veneration God is to be ſerued, ſince the chiefe Angels in heauen which alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde his face, dare not (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their highe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and long familiaritie) but reuerently feare him whiles they prayſe him. And what wilt thou Duſt and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes anſwere at the day of iudgement, when thou ſhalt be reprehended for thy drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe and diſtractions in a
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:16228:175"/>worke ſo diuine that thou waſt not worthy to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed therein? Learne ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from henceforth (being taught by ſuch a Preſident) to prayſe thy God with feare, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, atention, vigilancye and loue.</p>
            <p>An other Office of Angels is to offer vp the prayers of men to God; And to commend them alſo by their ſuffrage: For ſo ſpeaketh the Angel <hi>Raphael</hi> in the booke of <hi>Tobyas When thou didſt pray with teares,
<note place="margin">Tob, 12</note> and didſt bury the dead, and left thy dinner, I offered thy prayer to our Lord.</hi> And in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calips <hi>Iohn</hi> ſawe an Angel ſtanding before the <hi>Altar</hi> with a golden Cenſer:
<note place="margin">Apoc, 8</note> 
               <hi>And
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:16228:176"/>there were</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>giuen to him many incenſes, that he ſhould giue of the prayers of all ſaintes vpon the Altar of golde, which is before the throne of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this truely the great mercy of God doth alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. For he was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, firſt by his Prophets and after by his ſonne and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to exhort vs to pray: but alſo promiſed to giue whatſoeuer we ſhould aske: <hi>Aske</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and it ſhall be giuen you.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 11</note> And in an other place:
<note place="margin">Ioh, 15</note> 
               <hi>Yf you ſhall aske my Father any thing in my name, he will giue it you.</hi> And beſide this promiſe he alſo added <hi>A reward to thoſe that aske:
<note place="margin">Math. 9</note> But thou</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when thou
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:16228:176"/>ſhalt pray, enter into thy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and hauing ſhut the dore, pray to thy Father in ſecret: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>and thy father which ſeeth thee in ſecret, will repay thee,</hi> to wit areward, beſide the thinges which thou didſt aske. For ſo our Lord ſpeaketh in that place, of prayer and <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Neither is God content with this demonſtration of fahterly loue: But hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Angels as maſters of Requeſtes to take charge of the prayers and petitions of the poore, and to preſent and reade them in his ſight, that no one of their Petitions may be forgotten. What
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:16228:177"/>Prince in the world did euer promiſe rewardes to thoſe that came to demand of him mercy or iuſtice? And yet thoſe which come to the Princes of the World are men and the Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alſo are men made of the ſame molde, and ſubiect to the ſame Almighty God. But albeit it may ſeeme much to reward thoſe that aske: yet ought it not ſeeme much to giue them free acceſſe, to appoint faithfull maſters of Requeſtes to keepe their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, and to offer them vp and ſollicite their ſpeedy diſpatch.</p>
            <p>The third Office of Angels is to be ſent as Ambaſſadours to denounce ſuch thinges as
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:16228:177"/>God will haue denounced, eſpeciall concerning our Redemption and ſaluation. So ſpeaketh the Apoſtle to the Hebrewes:
<note place="margin">Heb. 1</note> 
               <hi>Are not all</hi> (the Angels) <hi>miniſtring Spirits: Sent to miniſter for them which ſhall receaue the inheritance of ſaluation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We reade alſo in many places of the olde Yeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<note place="margin">Gen, 18</note> how Angels appeared to the Patriarches and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and manyfeſted to them ſuch thinges as God would haue manifeſted.
<note place="margin">Dan, 9</note> We finde likewiſe in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament that the Angel <hi>Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> was ſent as an Ambaſſador from God to <hi>Zacharie</hi> and to the virgin Mother of God.
<note place="margin">Luke 1</note>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 2</note> Angels alſo were ſent to the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:16228:178"/>ſhepheards, to St. <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and after the Reſurrection of our Lord to the women that ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Sepulcher,
<note place="margin">Ioh, 20</note> and after the Aſcention,
<note place="margin">Math 28 Act, 1</note> to all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples. But if any aske, why God (who is euery where, and can eaſily by himſelfe ſpeake in the hearts of men) ſendeth notwithſtanding his Angels? I anſwer, becauſe men may vnderſtand that God regardeth their affaires, and that all thinges are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned and ordered by him. For otherwiſe they might perſwade themſelues that Gods inſpirations did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from their owne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and counſaile: But when they ſee or heare that Angels are ſent by God,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:16228:178"/>and the thinges which the Angels foretold, to come ſo truely to paſſe; they cannot doubt but that God foreſeeth mans affayres, &amp; doth cheiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly direct and diſpoſe ſuch thinges as appertaine to the ſaluation of his Elect.</p>
            <p>The fourth Office of Angells is to protect men both in particular and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. For it pleaſed the mercy of God to commend vnto his ſtrongeſt ſeruants the cuſtodye of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. And to appoint them as Tutors ouer Children, Gardians ouer Infantes Patrons ouer Clyents, ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes our ſheepe, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions ouer ſicke folkes, Defendors ouer Orphans,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:16228:179"/>and ſuch as cannot defend themſelues but vnder the winges of the more mighty.</p>
            <p>Of the protection of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men <hi>Dauid</hi> witneſſeth: <hi>He hath giuen his Angels charge rf thee,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 90</note> that they keepe thee in all thy wayes.</hi> And Chriſt himſelfe is alſo a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full witneſſe heereof: <hi>See</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that you deſpiſe not one of theſe little ones,
<note place="margin">Math, 18</note> for I ſay to you, that their Angells in heauen alwayes doe ſee the face of my Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> Touching their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection alſo of Prouinces and kingdomes <hi>Daniel</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth:
<note place="margin">Dan. 10</note> Who calleth the Gardian Angel of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Perſia, the king of Perſia, and the Gardian
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:16228:179"/>Angell of the Kingdome of <hi>Greece,</hi> the King of <hi>Greece,</hi> And the Gardian Angell of the Children of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> he calleth by his name <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaell.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apcc. 2</note> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> likewiſe in the <hi>Apocalips</hi> writeth of the Angells <hi>Gardians</hi> of <hi>Churches</hi> and maketh mention <hi>Of the Angell of the Church of</hi> Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>of</hi> Smyrna, and of others.</p>
            <p>Therefore in euery King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, there are two Kinges; the one a viſible Man, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an inuiſible Angell: And in euery Church there are two Biſhops; the one a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, the other an inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Angell: And in the vniuerſal Catholique Church there are two chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">Pſal, 89</note> in the morning he ſhall flouriſh and paſſe: in the euening he ſhall fall, be hardened and withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> For in the morning, to wit, in Childhood, Mans body flouriſheth like an bearbe, and ſoone after fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth youth: In the Noone-tyde of youth, it flouriſheth, and ſoone after followeth olde age: in the euening of olde age it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth by death, and in the graue it is harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, withered, and turned to duſt.</p>
            <p>Beholde therefore O my ſoule how farre thy bodie is from eternitie: But thou waſt created in time, where as before thou waſt

Take heede then leaſt thou be ſeduced by
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:16228:191"/>the allurements of thy fleſh, to the euerlaſting perdition both of thy ſelfe and it:

            <p>It followeth then,

<pb n="349" facs="tcp:16228:192"/>For the Water is higher then the Earth, becauſe it is more pure, and for the ſame cauſe, the Ayer is higher, then the Water, and the Fire then the Ayer, and the Heauen then the Fire.</p>

            <p> God therefore who is <hi>A pure Act,</hi> needeth neither Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, nor Imagination, nor Forme, nor the preſence of any Obiect without himſelfe; for his eſſence is to him all thinges: Neither can he haue any thing, which he hath not alwayes actually had; and to haue Alwayes actually, is alwayes to be a Pure and ſimple Act: Therefore the Nature of God is moſt high, and which cannot by any meanes haue an equall.

            <p>GReat is our Lord,
<note place="margin">Cap. 1</note> and there is no end of his Greatneſſe. For he is not great onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Omnipotencie is his higth; infinite wiſdome his depth; incomprehenſible mercie his breadth; &amp; iuſtice like a rod of yron his length; but alſo for that theſe Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes are infinite in breadth, length, higth and depth.</p>
            <p>And to begin from his
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:16228:204"/>Power, or rather his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency: The breath of Gods power conſiſteth in extention to infinite thinges.</p>
            <p>Firſt it is extended to all thinges made: for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the greateſt Angel to the leaſt Worme, or from the higheſt Heauen to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Hell, which was not made by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of God:

            </p>
            <p>Secondly it is extended to all thinges that ſhalbe made. For as nothing hath bin made but by him: ſo likewiſe nothing ſhall be made but by him. So ſpeaketh the Apoſtle:

And who is able ſo to doe, but hee whoſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is Infinite?

               <note place="margin">Heb, 1</note>
            </p>
            <p>Others wonder how it can be that in Hell the fire is not conſumed which burneth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſtingly, nor the bodyes of thoſe wretches diſſolued, which are for euer ſcorched in thoſe flames. And this may be thought not onely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable but alſo vnpoſſble, were it not that God (who is Almighty and Euerlaſting) cauſeth that fire ſo to burne that it is neuer quenched; and ſo preſerueth the bodyes of thoſe wretches in that fire; that they are alwayes tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and neuer conſumed.</p>
            <p>Others wonder moreouer,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:16228:207"/>how God Carrieth and ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all thinges, and yet is not wearied with ſo huge a burthen. For a ſtrong Man, Horſe, Oxe, or Elephant, can carry a great weight a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while: or a very great weight a very ſhort while: But to carry a moſt great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then an euerlaſting time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wearineſſe, ſurpaſſeth the ſtrength of any Creature.</p>
            <p>But indeed they had cauſe to wonder, if the Power of God were in Weight and Meaſure, as the power of Creatures is.</p>
            <p>But ſince his power is Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, it is no meruaile if it can beare a great burthen an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite time without weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Let vs ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

For often times in holy Scripture God is ſaid to do thoſe things whereof be is the Cauſe that they are done. As in Geneſis when our Lord ſaid to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham: Now haue I knowen that thou feareſt God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 22</note> the meaning
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:16228:209"/>of thoſe wordes is: Now haue I cauſed, that both thy ſelfe and others know that thou truely feareſt God.</p>
            <p>The like alſo was that worke (ſignifying the height of Gods power) at the Paſſion of our Lord: When the Moone which was very farre diſtant from the Sunne; approached with vncredible ſpeed vnto the Sun; &amp; Ecclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it three houres,
<note place="margin">Math. 27</note> cauſed darkneſſe <hi>vpon the whole earth,</hi> &amp; after with like ſpeed; retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the place from whence ſhe came: All which St. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> (in his Epiſtle to St. <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpe</hi>) doth witnes that he ſaw and obſerued. And this truely is a wonder co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, though no leſſe ſtrange;
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:16228:210"/>For it is as vnuſuall, and as much aboue the whole power of Nature, to make the Moone runne her courſe more ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily then ſhe is accuſtomed, as it is to make her ſtand ſtill.</p>
            <p>I omit the giuing ſight to the blinde, the rayſing of the dead, and many ſuch like mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, which God hath done, and doth by his Prophets, Apoſtles, and other his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruantes; All which doe crye, <hi>Who is like to thee among the ſtrong O Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I cannot omitt that cheife and greateſt Miracle, which God ſhall ſhew at the day of Iudgement; when all the dead ſhall riſe together: albeit the bodyes of many of them haue beene burned to
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:16228:210"/>aſhes, and ſcattered in the Windes; or deuoured by beaſtes, and changed into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bodies; or buried in fieldes and Orchards, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into ſundry hearbes.</p>
            <p>Which of the Angells but will wonder, to behold in the twinckling of an eye, ſo many Millions of Millions of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of men, at the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Almightie, to take againe their bodies, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they haue lyen hidd for many ages, and after diners manners haue bene diſperſed and conſumed?

            </p>
            <p>There remaineth the depth
<note place="margin">Cap. 4</note>
               <pb n="386" facs="tcp:16228:211"/>of his power, which ſeemeth to me to conſiſt in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which God vſeth in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thinges. For who can conceaue how ſomthing <hi>is made of nothing?</hi> They could not ſound this depth, who held it for a certaine and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued Principle: <hi>That of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nothing is made.</hi> And we alſo in this beleeue what we ſee not: but we belecue God who cannot lye. I ſay we beleeue that heauen and earth, and all thinges that are therein, were created by God, without anyprecedent matter whereof they were made. But how this could be done, is a thing too deepe for vs to finde out. Moreouer, God did not onely make all thinges <hi>of
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:16228:211"/>nothing, but alſo in nothing;</hi> to wit without precedent ſpace or place to containe them in: which is hard to vnderſtand, eſpecially in corporall things. And therefore this depth alſo is not to be founded. <hi>Take away</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Dardanus) the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of plaeces from bodies,
<note place="margin">Epiſt. 57</note> and they ſhall be no where, and becauſe they ſhall be no where, they ſhall not be.</hi> If therefore, nothing was before God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated heauen and earth, where did he place heauen &amp; earth? Truely not in Nothing: And yet they are created, &amp; placed in themſelues, becauſe he ſo would and could who can do all thinges, although we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceaue how they are
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:16228:212"/>done. This did God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſignifie, when (declaring his omnipotence to holy <hi>Iob)</hi> he ſaid:
<note place="margin">Iob. 38</note> 
               <hi>Where waſt thou when I layd the foundations of the earth? tell me if thou haſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, who ſet the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures thereof, if thou knowe? Or who ſtretched out the lyne v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it? Vpon what are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations thereof grounded? Or who let downe the corner ſtone thereof?</hi> And that we might vnderſtand theſe workes of Gods omnipotence to be moſt worthy of all prayſe, our Lord himſelfe preſently addeth: <hi>When the morning ſtarrs prayſed me together, and all the ſonnes of God mode in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilation:</hi> To wit the Holy Angells which were created
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:16228:212"/>together with heauen and earth; and are as it were <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſtarrs</hi> ſo bright that they may be called <hi>the ſonnes of God;</hi> when they ſawe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth created of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and placed in nothing; and yet to be moſt firmely founded vpon their owne ſtabilitie; with wonderfull admiration and iubilation, they prayſed the omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their maker. Neither is it leſſe profound to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, how God by the onely command of his will, did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect ſuch huge buildinges. For we knowe that in edifices leſſe without compariſon, how many inſtruments, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes, and workemen <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiteckes</hi> want. Who therfore
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:16228:213"/>can conceaue how by Will onely (which neuer goeth out of the thing that willeth) ſo great and manyfold workes could be made? God ſayd (but to himſelfe for <hi>the word of God is in God and is God)</hi> He ſayd (I ſay) commanding and expreſſing the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his will:
<note place="margin">Gen, 1 Ioh. 1</note> 
               <hi>Be Heauen made, and heauen was made: Be earth made, and earth was made: Be light made: Be a Sunne made: Be ſtarrs made: Be Trees made: Be Beaſtes made: Be Men made: Be Angells made:</hi> And all things were made. Add alſo that the ſame God can if he will deſtroy <hi>all thinges with one becke</hi> as we read in the books of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Machahies.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Mach, 8</note> It is likewiſe
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:16228:213"/>
               <hi>a depth vnſoundable</hi> how God made all theſe great and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold thinges conſiſting of ſo many partes and members in a moment? Nature and Art with vs require a long time to perfect their workes. We ſee hearbes are ſowen long before they growe: and oftentimes many yeares paſſe before trees take roote, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their boughes, and bring forth fruite: Beaſtes likewiſe carry their young ones long within them: and after they ſeede them long alſo before they growe great. I will ſay nothing of Art; for experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſheweth, that our Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans can bring nothing to perfection, but in a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent time.</p>
            <pb n="392" facs="tcp:16228:214"/>
            <p> How great therefore is the power of God which in a moment hath brought ſo great thinges to perfection? But I diſpute not, whether God in a moment made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, and all thinges therein; or whether he ſpent ſix whole dayes in the firſt Creation of thinges. For I vndertake not to cleere doubts: but to <hi>frame Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> vnto God from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thinges.

<pb n="436" facs="tcp:16228:236"/>and Caſtles full of men. To a Horſe a body ſomewhat leſſe, becauſe he is to carry but one ryder.

The like we may ſay of <hi>Number,</hi> God hath made but one Sunne, becauſe one Sunne ſuffiſed to giue light to the whole earth, and with his brightneſſe to make the day. He made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo but one Moone, becauſe one Moone ſuffiſed to giue light in the night: Yet would he haue many ſtarres, that when as the Sunne and Moon
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:16228:236"/>were both abſent (as at their comunction it happeneth) they might in ſome ſort put away the darkeneſſe of the night. Neither hath he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſigned a neceſſary <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> to all thinges ingenerall, but alſo hath appointed to each thing in particular ſuch Number of partes, that there can nothing be added or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. God hath giuen a man two eyes, two eares, two handes, two feete, one noſe, one mouth, one breaſt, one head: And he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a very beautifull and comely creature: Change this order: Let a man haue one eye, two noſes, one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Moreouer God hath giuen Weight, to wit that eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to euery Creature as the Nature thereof doth require.

But it is merueylous to conſider what vertue God
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:16228:237"/>hath giuen to ſundry very ſmall and ſlender Creatures, that as his power is in great, ſo his wiſdome might be ſeen in ſmall-thinges.

Which alſo may be ſaid of the nouriſhment and growth of all liuing creatures as the Apoſtle witneſſeth ſaying:

            <pb n="446" facs="tcp:16228:241"/>
            <p> And if the Wiſdome of God doth feede, nouriſh and preſerue Plantes and Beaſtes in this mortall life after ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable a manner, thinke if thou canſt O my ſoule how God doth feede the mindes of Angells and Men in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life? For on Earth wee are fedd with earthly meates, albeit they are ſeaſoned by Gods Wiſdome: But in Heauen, Wiſdome it ſelfe is the meate and drinke of thoſe that liue for euer.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But let vs proceed.

Men take great paines to make the wheeles of a Clocke runne by force of weights foure and twenty houres.</p>
            <p>How great then is the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, who cauſeth the nouriſhing Facultie to worke without ceaſſing ſo
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:16228:242"/>long as men, beaſtes, or trees doe liue? And the longues and pulſes to mooue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſeauenty yeares and more. For of neceſſitie the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ouriſhing facultye muſt worke, and the longues and pulſes muſt mooue from the firſt entrance into life, vntill the end thereof. Thoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that liue vntill ſoure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore or ninetie yeares of age, muſt of neceſſitie haue their longues and pulſes mooue all that while. And before the ſloud when men liued nine hundred yeares, their longues and pulſes (which are thinges very ſmall and ſoone out of temper) wrought nine hundred yeares without reſt or intermiſſion.
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:16228:242"/>Truely, they that wonder at theſe thinges and doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and adore Gods Wiſdome in them, are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe depriued of all light of Wiſdome.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, albeit Gods Wiſdome can without the labour of men and beaſtes and without the miniſterie of the Sunne or other ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary cauſes, produce and preſerue herbes and trees, ſo that all liuing creatures might haue meate in readineſſe: yet it pleaſed him to vſe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of ſecundary cauſes, and the labour and induſtry of men and of beaſtes, that none might be idle; but that euery one might exerciſe their ſtrength.</p>
            <pb n="450" facs="tcp:16228:243"/>
            <p> He would alſo that among men ſome ſhould be rich, and ſome poore, that they all might haue occaſion to loue vertue, and to be tyed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the bond of Charity.</p>
            <p>For the rich may therefore vſe Mercy and Liberality: and the poore, Patience and Humility. The Rich alſo need the labour of the Poore, to till their fieldes, to feede their Cattle, and by diuers trades to prouide ſuch things as euery one hath neede of.</p>
            <p>The Poore againe want the helpe of the Rich, to giue them money and meanes to prouide for themſelues meat, drinke, cloath, and other neceſſaryes. Neither is there any canſe why the poore
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:16228:243"/>ſhould complaine of Gods Wiſdome: For God (who knoweth all and loueth all) hath giuen to euery one what hee fore-ſaw, to be moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for them, to obtaine euerlaſting life.</p>
            <p>As earthly Phiſitions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund ſome of their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents to be let bloud: &amp; others to drinke wine, eate fleſh, and vſe recreation. Many poore folkes doubtleſſe ſhall now be ſaued, who if they had bin rich, had periſhed eternally.</p>
            <p>And although the rich may alſo be ſaued, if they ſeeke to be rich in Good workes, and giue that willingly which they receiued of our common Lord, not to hide but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow: Yet it cannot be

<pb n="454" facs="tcp:16228:245"/>but many declyne from it with all their affection and power.</p>
            <p>Laſtly the length of Gods wiſdome is ſeene, in that as it is it ſelfe eternall, ſo it hath engrafted in all thinges a moſt liuely inſtinct to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue themſelues, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long their life and being as long as they can.

We ſee droppes of water hanging ſome-time vpon wood or ſtone to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come round, and to holde themſelues together as long as they can, leaſt they fall and periſh.</p>
            <p>We ſee heauie thinges againſt nature to aſcend, and light thinges to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend leaſt <hi>Vacuitie</hi> ſhould happen, whereby they be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing ſeuered from the reſt of thinges, could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.

<pb n="494" facs="tcp:16228:265"/>The breadth of Gods mercy is ſeene in that he onely can take away all miſeries, and from all creatures he taketh away ſome for the loue he beareth them, and not for any profit to himſelfe. Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures indeed can take away ſome miſeries: as bread hunger, drinke thirſt, cloathes nakedneſſe, knowledge igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſo of the reſt: but no creature can take away all miſeries.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, there are ſome miſeries the greater, the more ſecret and inward they are, which God onely can reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.

            <p>Who can deliuer vs from theſe miſeries, but onely our Almighty phiſition? And he alſo doth often mercifully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vs from them without our knowledge: for which cauſe we all may iuſtly be ſaid vnkinde to God, as our Lord himſelfe doth witneſſe when he ſaith:

            <p>Moreouer, this patience ſeemeth yet greater in that many ſinners being by Gods grace brought out <hi>of the lake of miſerie,

            <p>For that courſe which he vſeth in forgiuing oftences, the ſame would he haue vs vſe alſo: but he hath ſet downe no certaine time for recontiliation but the terme of this life. As long as a ſinner liueth although it be an hundred yeares or more and

            <p>There is alſo another Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganimity of God exceeding admirable and amiable, which he vſeth in ſuffering the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences of the righteous.

            <p>Some men haue mercy of other men, becauſe they need their helpe: and this indeed

            <p>Others haue mercy by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Conſanguinity or friendſhip, to witt, becauſe they are their Children, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Familiars, or Friendes: and this degree is a little higher, and beginneth to haue the Forme of a vertue.</p>
            <p>Laſtly others haue mercy becauſe they are their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to wit men as they are, made by the ſame God, and of the ſame molde. And therefore they reſpect not whether they be their friends or enimies, good or euill,

<note place="margin">Math. 10</note> For what deſert can be more baſe and obſcure, then to giue a cup of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to one that is a thirſt? And yet for it alſo hath God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed a reward. And of the large rewards which our Lord hath promiſed Saint <hi>Luke</hi> writeth: <hi>Good meaſure,
<note place="margin">Luk. 6</note> and preſſed downe, and ſhaken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and running ouer ſhall they giue into your boſome.</hi> Neither is it to be feared leaſt God
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:16228:290"/>ſhould want any thing to giue for reward vnto the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſince hee is the Lord of all thinges, and can by his worde onely, increaſe and multiply them without end.</p>
            <p>Nor is it to be doubted, leſt perhaps he be deceiued in the true number &amp; value of their deſertes: ſince hee is moſt Wiſe &amp; beholdeth all things; ſearching the Harts &amp; reynes of his well deſeruing ſeruants to ſee with what minde, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, zeale and diligence they doe all thinges. Neither may it be thought, that God hath an ill meaning to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraude his children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes of their due recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, becauſe he is faithfull in all his wordes.</p>
            <pb n="545" facs="tcp:16228:290"/>
            <p> Laſtly, neither can he dye, becauſe he is more immortall then any thing whatſoeuer: ſo that there is no danger leſt by preuention of death they ſhould be thereof deprined.</p>
            <p>Certaine therefore it is that all the good workes of the righteous are with luſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. Wherefore it is moſt ſafe to haue to doe with God in matter of labour and Reward: and dangerous to truſt in men, and to expect from them true recompence for deſert.</p>

            <p>Firſt it is a dreadfull thing that the Creature ſhould not obey the Creator, ſeeing the dignity of the Creator is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely diſtant, from the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Creature. The Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature is alſo by nature the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, &amp; the Creator is by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

            <p>Secondly although the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of the Creator were heauy: yet ought the Creature to obey them:
<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 1</note>

                  </note> and burthen light.</hi> How great an offence then is it for wormes of the earth not to obey their Creator in ſo eaſie a matter?</p>
            <p>Thirdly if God had not threatned the puniſhment of eternall death vnto ſinners: Men might herhapps haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed their ſinnes: but ſeeing he hath ſo often and ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threatned it by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

            <p>Laſtly, if the ſinne of the damned were not eternall, we might meruaile why the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment thereof ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall: but ſeeing the abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of the damned is eternal, why ſhould wee wonder if their puniſhment be alſo eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall? And this wilfull obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in wickednes w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is both in the damned and in the Deuils: I ſay this peruerſe will which is in them auerted from God the cheife Happineſſe, &amp; ſhall ſo for euer remaine: maketh holy men more to feare a mortall ſinne, then Hell fire.</p>
